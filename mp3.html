<h1> Welcome to Kelly Guthrie's MP3: Digital Audio</h1>



<h2>About the Audio File</h2>
<p>This audio file was created as a an artifact for my Hypermedia and Multimedia Instructional Technology course. This audio file will also be used on my ePotfolio for my master's program. If you listen to this audio, you will learn more about me and my educational background. </p>

<h2>Audio File Editing and Creation</h2>
<p>First, I downloaded music from Bensound.com to not violate copyright law. I used these tracks because they were professional and made the audio more exciting to listen to. I downloaded both tracks and then recorded my introduction. I first faded in the first track. 
Then I reduced the amplifaction of the second track so it does not overpower my introduction recording since the audio overlapped. I then faded out the second track. Lastly, I removed the mouse clicks from adding the recorded introduction.</p>
